## Building the project

### macOS/Linux

In order to successfully build the project we need a C++ compiler, [CMake](https://cmake.org/) and also the [SDL](https://www.libsdl.org/) graphics libraries: `SDL2`, `SDL2_image` and `SDL2_ttf`.

In Debian/Ubuntu, this can be achieved by running the command:

```bash
apt-get install -y g++ cmake libsdl2-dev libsdl2-image-dev libsdl2-ttf-dev
```

In macOS, we can run:

```bash
brew install cmake sdl2 sdl2_image sdl2_ttf
```

Then we just download the code, build the project and run the program:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/fredericojordan/fast-chess.git
cd fast-chess
cmake .
make
./chess
```
